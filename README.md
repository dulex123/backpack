# README Boilerplate

I use this backpack repo for my software engineering adventures!
Change this readme as needed.

## Installation

Download to your project directory, add it, and commit.

```sh
curl -O https://github.com/christianbundy/readme-boilerplate.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add README Boilerplate"
```

## Usage

Edit `README.md` with the name of your project, a description, installation instructions, usage instructions, how to get support, and how people can contribute to your project.

## Support

none, nada, aucune...

## Contributing

Fork the project, create a new branch, make your changes, and open a pull request.

We use [Clear code](http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11style/) writing guidelines.
